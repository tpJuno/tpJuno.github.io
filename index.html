    <p id="content">In January 2003, the <a href="http://www.thehighline.org/">Friends of the High Line</a> launched a proposal for the Design and Retrieving the High Line. An open society, an international competition of ideas, attract innovative proposals for the reuse of the High Line. The proposals do not necessarily have to be practical or realistic, participants were encouraged to be bold and create visions as unique and unexpected as the High Line itself.
    <br>
    <br>
    720 individuals and teams from 36 countries submitted proposals for the competition, of which there were four finalists. In October 2004, a Steering Committee comprising representatives of the City of New York and Friends of the High Line, the team selected James Corner of Field Operations (landscape architecture) and Diller Scofidio + Renfro (architecture) to begin the work, a park in height, 9 meters above ground level and with a total length of 2.33 kms.</p>
